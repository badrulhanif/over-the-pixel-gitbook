### Best Practices

* **Tell a story:** Structure it like a narrative with a problem, struggle, and resolution
* **Be honest**: Share challenges, mistakes, and how you fixed them
* **Focus on your process:** Not just the polished screens
* **Use visuals generously**: Images say more than words
* **Add metrics**: Numbers make your work credible
* **Keep it readable**: Avoid jargon and keep sections clear
* **Tailor it**: Make each case study relevant to the job you’re applying for
