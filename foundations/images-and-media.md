# Principles of Good Design

To guide designers in making better choices, we follow a set of principles — rules and best practices that help create meaningful, usable experiences.

### Key Principles of Good Design

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Clarity

Good design makes things clear and easy to understand.\
Your users shouldn’t have to guess what a button does or what step comes next. If something’s confusing, it’s bad design.

Example:\
A big, labeled “Add to Cart” button tells people what will happen if they click it.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Consistency

Use the same patterns, colors, icons, and layouts across your product.\
This builds familiarity and trust — people can predict what’s going to happen.

Example:\
If your app uses a blue button for “Confirm” once, it should use it everywhere else too.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Visual Hierachy

Guide people’s eyes to what matters most.\
Use size, color, space, and contrast to show what’s important first, second, and last.

Example:\
A large product name, followed by a medium price, then smaller product details.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Feedback

Your design should respond to users’ actions.\
When people click, swipe, or type — show them what’s happening.

Example:\
A button changes color when you hover, or a loading spinner appears after clicking “Submit.”
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Affordance

Design elements should look like how they behave.\
Buttons should look clickable. Sliders should look draggable. Text links should stand out.

Example:\
A raised, colored rectangle with a label looks like something you can press.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Accessibility

Design for everyone — including people with different abilities.\
Use readable fonts, good color contrast, clear icons, and proper labels.

Example:\
Avoid tiny text or low-contrast colors that are hard for visually impaired users to read.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Simplicity

Remove anything unnecessary.\
Focus only on what’s important and helpful. Too much clutter can confuse and overwhelm users.

Example:\
A clean, focused checkout page with only the essential fields: name, address, payment.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Delight

Add little moments of joy or surprise.\
Microinteractions, animations, or clever details can turn a good experience into a great one.

Example:\
A cute success animation when you finish a task in an app.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

#### Bonus Principle: **User-Centered Design**

Keep the user’s needs and experiences at the forefront. A design may be beautiful, but if it doesn’t serve the user’s needs effectively, it’s not truly “good” design. Always prioritize usability, accessibility, and intuitive flow.
