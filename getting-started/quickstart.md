# Quickstart

Let’s keep it simple.

UI stands for User Interface. It’s everything you see on the screen — buttons, text, icons, colors, spacing, layout. It’s the look and feel of a product. Think of UI as the makeup of the design—it’s what gives your app or website a personality.

UX stands for User Experience. It’s how the product feels to use. Is it easy to find what you’re looking for? Can you complete a task without getting stuck? UX is the vibe of the journey — how smooth, helpful, or frustrating it feels.

> Imagine you’re ordering food through a delivery app:
>
> * The UI is the menu screen, the icons, the cart button, and how the food is displayed.
> * The UX is how easy it was to find your favorite meal, customize it, check out, and track delivery.

They work together. A beautiful UI doesn’t help if the UX is broken. And a great UX can feel dull without thoughtful UI.

Still not sure how UI and UX are different? We break it down clearly in [this section](../foundations/editor.md).

### Think like a designer

Design isn’t just about how something looks or even how it feels — it’s about solving real problems for real people. That’s where Design Thinking comes in.

It’s a mindset that helps designers create meaningful, user-centered experiences by focusing on people — not just pixels.

Instead of diving straight into visuals, Design Thinking begins with empathy. You take the time to understand your users — what they need, what frustrates them, and what truly makes their experience better.&#x20;

Good design isn’t an accident. It’s a process. Learn the core mindset behind great design [here](../foundations/markdown.md).

This thoughtful approach turns design from decoration into real impact. It’s about designing with purpose, not guesswork.
