# Design System

A Design System is a collection of reusable components, guidelines, standards, and assets that help teams build consistent, efficient, and scalable digital products. It’s more than a style guide — it’s a living, evolving ecosystem that bridges design and development.

Think of it as a **toolbox** + **rulebook** for creating user interfaces.

### Why is a Design System Important?

* **Consistency**\
  Ensures a unified visual language and behavior across the entire product.
* **Efficiency**\
  Speeds up the design and development process by reusing components.
* **Collaboration**\
  Aligns cross-functional teams (design, dev, product) with shared resources.
* **Scalability**\
  Makes it easier to grow and evolve the product without chaos.
* **Maintenance**\
  Reduces design and technical debt by centralizing updates.
