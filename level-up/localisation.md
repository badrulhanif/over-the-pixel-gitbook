# Localisation

Localisation is the process of adapting a product’s content, layout, language, and functionality to meet the cultural, linguistic, and regional preferences of different target audiences.

It’s not just about translating words — it’s about ensuring your product feels natural, familiar, and usable for people from different regions, cultures, and backgrounds.

### Localisation vs Internationalisation

### Localisation Challenges

#### **1. Text Expansion**

Some languages take up more space than others (e.g. German text is often longer than English).

#### **2. Reading Direction**

Left-to-right (LTR) vs. right-to-left (RTL) languages (like Arabic or Hebrew).

#### **3. Cultural Sensitivity**

Avoid culturally inappropriate images, colors, gestures, or expressions.

#### **4. Units & Standards**

Kilograms vs. pounds, kilometers vs. miles, Celsius vs. Fahrenheit.
