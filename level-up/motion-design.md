# Motion Design

Motion Design is the use of movement and animation to enhance the user experience in digital products. It brings interfaces to life, providing users with visual cues, transitions, feedback, and storytelling through carefully considered motion.

### Why Motion Design?

* **Guides attention**\
  Motion can highlight important elements or lead users through a process.
* **Makes interactions feel natural**\
  Smooth transitions mimic real-world physics, making digital experiences feel tangible.
* **Provides feedback**\
  Motion lets users know something is happening (loading, success, error, etc.).
* **Improves perceived performance**\
  A smart animation can make wait times feel shorter and actions more responsive.
* **Adds delight and personality**\
  Subtle animations can give your product character and improve emotional connection.

### Type of Motion
