# Design For Accessibility

Accessibility is a fundamental principle that enhances inclusivity, aligns with legal standards, and improves overall user experience.

By integrating accessibility into sitemaps, user flows, wireframes, components, prototypes, responsive design, usability testing, design systems, and atomic design, designers create interfaces that are equitable and effective.

> Ensures that digital products are usable by as many people as possible — including people with disabilities like visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments.

### Why Accessibility Matters

* 1 in 6 people globally live with some form of disability.
* Inclusive products reach a wider audience and improve usability for everyone.
* Accessible designs are often clearer, simpler, and more user-friendly — benefiting people without disabilities too.
* Helps meet legal and ethical standards (like WCAG and ADA guidelines).

### Key Principles of Accessible Design

{% step %}
### WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)

International standards for accessibility, organized into four principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust (POUR), with compliance levels A, AA, and AAA.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Perceivable

Information must be accessible to users’ senses (e.g., alt text for images, captions for videos).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Operable

Interfaces must be navigable and interactive (e.g., keyboard support, sufficient time for tasks).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Understandable

Content and interactions must be clear (e.g., simple language, consistent navigation).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Robust

Interfaces must work across devices and assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers, braille displays).
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Common Accessibility Considerations

#### 1. Visual

* High color contrast between text and backgrounds
* Avoid color-only information cues (e.g. error messages in red without text)
* Scalable font sizes and readable typography
* Focus indicators on interactive elements (like buttons)

#### 2. Auditory

* Provide captions and transcripts for audio/video content
* Avoid sound-based cues alone

#### 3. Motor

* Ensure everything can be navigated by keyboard only
* Allow sufficient clickable/tappable area sizes

#### 4. Cognitive

* Use clear, simple language
* Organize content with logical hierarchy
* Avoid flashing content (which can cause seizures)

### Accessibility Checklist

* [ ] Sufficient color contrast
* [ ] Keyboard navigation supported
* [ ] Focus indicators visible
* [ ] Alt text for images
* [ ] Form fields clearly labeled
* [ ] No color-only information cues
* [ ] Content organized in a logical order
