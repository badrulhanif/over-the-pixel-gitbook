# Components

Components are reusable, modular building blocks of a user interface, such as buttons, cards, or forms, designed to ensure consistency and efficiency in UI/UX design.

They serve as the foundation for scalable design systems, reducing redundancy and facilitating collaboration between designers and developers.

### Why need components?

* **Reusability**: Design components to be versatile, applicable across multiple screens or contexts to minimize duplication.
* **Consistency**: Ensure components adhere to the design system’s standards, including typography, colors, and spacing, to maintain a unified look.
* **Modularity**: Create components that are independent yet interoperable, allowing easy combination or modification without breaking the interface.
* **Clarity**: Document each component’s purpose, states, and usage to facilitate adoption by designers and developers.
* **Accessibility**: Build components with inclusive features, such as sufficient contrast ratios and keyboard navigability, to meet WCAG standards.

### Common UI Components

| Checkbox      | Enables selection of multiple options from a set.                                                                    |
| Radio Button  | Allows selection of a single option from a set.                                                                      |
| Dropdown Menu | Provides a list of options in a compact form.                                                                        |

| Tab           | Organizes content into separate views within the same context.                                                       |
| Modal Window  | Displays content in a layer above the main interface, often requiring interaction before returning to the main view. |
| Tooltip       | Offers brief information when hovering over an element.                                                              |
