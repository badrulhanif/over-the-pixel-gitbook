# Prototype

Prototypes are interactive mockups of a user interface that simulate functionality and user interactions, bridging the gap between static wireframes and final development.

### Why need prototype?

#### **1. Visualizing Ideas**

It turns abstract concepts into tangible, interactive models. Prototypes help designers, developers, and stakeholders align on what a product should look and feel like.

#### **2. Early Usability Testing**

Before investing time and resources in development, prototypes let you test user journeys, discover friction points, and gather real-world feedback from actual users.

#### **3. Fail Fast, Learn Faster**

Itâ€™s much easier and cheaper to fix problems at the prototype stage than after a product is built. Prototyping enables rapid iterations and quick decision-making.

#### **4. Stakeholder Buy-In**

An interactive prototype communicates ideas far better than static visuals. It makes presentations more persuasive and helps non-designers (like clients, managers, or investors) understand the product vision.

#### **5. Smooth Handoff to Developers**

Prototypes clarify functionality, animations, and interactions, reducing miscommunication and speeding up the handoff between design and development teams.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

* **Over-designing too early:** wasting time polishing before testing basic usability
* **Ignoring user feedback:** building based on assumptions instead of evidence
* **Skipping error states:** forgetting to prototype what happens when things go wrong
* **Poor device targeting:** only testing desktop when most users are on mobile
* **Too complex too soon:** making it difficult for stakeholders to give clear feedback

### Prototype vs. Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

| Prototype                      | MVP                          |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| No backend functionality       | Functional product           |
| Used for testing ideas         | Used to test market demand   |
| Fast to build, often throwaway | Slow to build, public-facing |
| Using design tools             | Using code                   |
