# Responsive Design

Responsive Design is the practice of designing and building digital products that adapt to different screen sizes, resolutions, and devices — ensuring a seamless, consistent user experience whether on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.

### Why is Responsive Design Important?

#### **1. Growing Mobile Usage**

More than half of global website traffic now comes from mobile devices.

#### **2. Consistent User Experience**

Users should have an equally intuitive experience on every device.

#### **3. Future-Proofing**

New devices emerge constantly — from foldable phones to smart TVs.

#### **4. SEO Benefits**

Google prioritizes mobile-friendly websites in its search rankings.

### Principles of Responsive Design

{% step %}
### Mobile-First Design

Start designing for smaller screens and progressively add complexity for larger screens, ensuring a solid base experience.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Content Prioritization

Arrange content based on user needs, stacking or hiding less critical elements on smaller screens.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Consistency

Maintain visual and functional coherence across devices, using the same components and grid systems (e.g., 8-point or 4-point grids).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Accessibility

Ensure responsive layouts support touch targets (min. 44px), readable font sizes (min. 16px), and sufficient contrast (WCAG 4.5:1).
{% endstep %}

### Performance Optimization

Minimize heavy assets and use techniques like lazy-loading images to enhance speed on mobile devices.

### Common Screen Breakpoints

| Breakpoint   | Screen Size | Device Type             | Layout Example                      |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 320px–480px  | Small       | Mobile Phones           | Single-column, stacked content      |
| 481px–768px  | Medium      | Tablets                 | Two-column grid, compact navigation |
| 769px–1024px | Large       | Small Desktops, Laptops | Three-column grid, sidebar visible  |
