# User Flow

User flows are visual representations of the paths users take to accomplish specific tasks within an application or website.They serve as blueprints that map out interactions, ensuring intuitive navigation and a seamless experience.

By delineating each step, decision, and outcome, user flows enable designers to anticipate user needs, identify potential friction points, and optimize interfaces. This section explores the foundational concepts, guiding principles, and practical applications of user flows, offering insights into their creation and strategic use in UI/UX design.
