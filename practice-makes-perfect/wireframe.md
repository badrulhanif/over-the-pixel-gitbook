# Wireframe

Wireframes are low-fidelity visual blueprints of a user interface, outlining the structure, layout, and functionality without detailed aesthetics.

It serve as a critical bridge between conceptual planning (e.g., sitemaps and user flows) and high-fidelity design, enabling designers to test ideas, align stakeholders, and refine usability early in the process.

### Create Low-Fidelity Wireframes

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Understand User Needs and Objectives

Gather insights into the target audience and defining the primary goals of the product. This foundational understanding will guide the overall structure and functionality of the wireframe.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Sketch Basic Layouts

Using simple tools like pen and paper, sketch rough outlines of the interface. Focus on the placement of key elements such as headers, content areas, navigation menus, and footers.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Define Content Hierachy

Prioritize information based on user needs and business objectives. Ensure that the most critical content is prominently positioned to capture user attention effectively.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Incorporate Navigation Flow

Map out how users will navigate through the interface. Clearly indicate links, buttons, and other interactive elements to visualize the user journey.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Use Placeholders

Represent images with boxes and use lines or dummy text (e.g., lorem ipsum) to simulate text areas. This approach keeps the focus on structure rather than detailed content.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Annotate Functionalities

Add brief notes to explain specific features or interactions, providing clarity for stakeholders reviewing the wireframe.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Review and Itterate

Share the wireframe with team members and stakeholders to gather feedback. Use this input to refine the structure and address any usability concerns.
{% endstep %}

### Wireframe vs Mockup

| Aspect     | Wireframe                                                 | Mockup                                                           |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition | A skeletal framework focusing on layout and functionality | A detailed visual representation showcasing design elements      |
| Fidelity   | Low-fidelity: simple, often grayscale, with placeholders  | High-fidelity: includes colors, typography, images               |
| Purpose    | To plan structure and user flow without distractions      | To present the visual design and aesthetics of the final product |
