# Typography

Typography is arranging text to make it readable, visually appealing, and effective in communicating information. It’s about guiding the user’s eye, establishing hierarchy, reinforcing brand identity, and ensuring accessibility.

From the boldness of a headline to the subtlety of body text, typography influences every aspect of the user experience.

### Understanding Typography

#### Typeface vs. Font

* **Typeface:** A family of fonts with a shared design (e.g., Roboto).
* **Font:** A specific style within a typeface (e.g., Roboto Bold, 16px).

#### Font Categories

* **Serif:** Fonts with small extensions at the ends of strokes (e.g., Times New Roman). They feel traditional and are often used for body text in print.
* **Sans-Serif:** Clean, modern fonts without serifs (e.g., Helvetica). Ideal for digital interfaces due to their readability on screens.
* **Script:** Decorative, handwriting-like fonts (e.g., Pacifico). Used sparingly for logos or headings.
* **Monospace:** Fixed-width fonts (e.g., Courier). Common in code editors or for a retro vibe

#### Typographic Hierarchy: The visual arrangement of text to show importance

* **Headings (H1-H6):** Larger, bolder fonts for titles and sections.
* **Body Text:** Smaller, regular fonts for main content.
* **Captions:** Even smaller text for secondary information.

#### Kerning, Leading, and Tracking

* **Kerning:** Adjusting space between individual letters.
* **Leading:** Space between lines of text.
* **Tracking:** Overall letter spacing in a block of text.

### Principles of Effective Typography

#### 1. **Readability and Legibility**

* **Readability:** Refers to how easily text can be read in context.
* **Legibility:** Concerns the clarity of individual characters.

> * Choose clear, simple typefaces.
> * Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background.
> * Avoid overly decorative fonts for body text.

#### 2. **Font Selection**

Select fonts that align with the brand's personality and the content's purpose. Limit the number of typefaces to maintain consistency — typically no more than two or three per design.

#### 3. **Hierarchy and Scale**

Establish a clear hierarchy to guide users through content. Use variations in size, weight, and style to differentiate headings, subheadings, and body text.

| Text Element | Font Size | Weight    |
| ------------ | --------- | --------- |
| H1           | 32px      | Bold      |
| H2           | 24px      | Semi-Bold |
| Body Text    | 16px      | Regular   |

#### 4. Consistency

Stick to 1-2 typefaces across the design to maintain a cohesive look. Use different weights or styles within the same family for variation.

#### 5. **Line Height and Spacing**

Proper line height improves readability. A general guideline is to set line height at 1.5 times the font size. For example, a 16px font size would have a line height of 24px.

#### 6. **Alignment and White Space**

Left-aligned text is generally easiest to read. Utilize white space to prevent clutter and give the design a clean, organized appearance.

### Psychological Impact of Typography on User Experience

* **Cognitive Load**: Simple, legible fonts (e.g., Open Sans) reduce mental effort, keeping users engaged. Complex fonts (e.g., ornate scripts) can overwhelm and increase bounce rates.
* **Emotional Triggers**: Rounded typefaces (e.g., Circular) feel friendly and approachable, while angular ones (e.g., DIN Next Pro) project authority—key for brand alignment.
* **Trust and Credibility**: Consistent, high-contrast typography signals professionalism. Studies show users trust sites more with clear, readable text (4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum).
* **Attention Flow**: Bold weights or italics direct focus—like highlighting a CTA button’s text to boost conversions.
* **Cultural Perception**: Typography carries cultural weight. Serif fonts often feel “classic” in Western design, while minimalist sans-serifs dominate tech-forward Asian markets.
