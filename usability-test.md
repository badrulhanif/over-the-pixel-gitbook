# Usability Test

**Usability Testing** is a user-centered evaluation method that helps designers, researchers, and product teams assess how real users interact with a product — identifying issues, frustrations, and opportunities for improvement before launch.

> It’s one of the most effective ways to ensure that a product is easy, efficient, and satisfying to use.

### Why is Usability Testing Important?

#### **1. Uncovers Hidden Issues**

Things that might seem obvious to designers can confuse users.

#### **2. Saves Time and Money**

Catching problems early reduces the cost of fixing them post-development.

#### **3. Validates Design Decisions**

It confirms whether the product behaves as users expect.

#### **4. Improves User Satisfaction**

A smooth, frustration-free experience keeps users coming back.

### Usability Testing Methods

| Method      | Description              | Use Case                          | Pros                     | Cons                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Moderated   | Facilitator guides users | Early prototypes, complex flows   | Real-time insights       | Time-intensive            |
| Unmoderated | Users test independently | Responsive designs, large samples | Scalable, cost-effective | Less control over context |
| Guerrilla   | Informal tests in public | Quick wireframe feedback          | Fast, low-cost           | Limited user diversity    |
| A/B Testing | Compare two versions     | Optimize specific components      | Data-driven              | Requires clear variables  |

### Feedback Types

* **Qualitative:** Verbal or written insights (e.g., "The button was hard to find").
* **Quantitative:** Measurable data (e.g., 80% success rate).

### Metrics

* **Success Rate**: Percentage of users completing tasks correctly.
* **Time on Task**: Duration to complete a task, indicating efficiency.
* **Error Rate**: Frequency of mistakes, highlighting usability issues.
* **Satisfaction**: User feedback on ease and enjoyment, often via surveys.
